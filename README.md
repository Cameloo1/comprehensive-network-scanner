### Authorization File
For non-lab targets, create an `AUTHORIZATION.txt` file:
```
# Add your authorization details here
# This file allows scanning of external targets
```

## Progress Tracking

NetScan features a comprehensive progress tracking system:

```
Progress: [████████████████████████░░░░░░]  80.0% | Completed: 4/5 | Active Workers: 1/2 | Failed: 0 | ETA: 0:00:57

Scan Complete!
   Total Targets: 5
   Completed: 5
   Failed: 0
   Success Rate: 100.0%
   Total Time: 0:03:49
   Avg Time/Target: 0:00:45
```

### Progress Features
- **Real-time progress bar** with visual completion indicator
- **Worker monitoring** showing active vs maximum workers
- **ETA calculation** based on current scan performance

- Detailed technical findings
- Remediation recommendations

### Report Contents
- **Executive Summary**: High-level overview and risk assessment
- **Host Information**: IP addresses, reverse DNS, WHOIS data
- **Open Ports**: Discovered services and versions
- **Vulnerabilities**: Security findings with severity ratings
- **TLS Analysis**: SSL/TLS configuration assessment
- **Web Fingerprinting**: Application and service identification

## Security Considerations

### Safe Mode
NetScan operates in safe mode by default, which:
- Uses only non-destructive vulnerability templates
- Implements timeout protection to prevent hanging
- Avoids aggressive scanning techniques
- Focuses on information gathering rather than exploitation

### Authorization
- **Lab Networks**: Automatically authorized (127.x, 192.168.x, 10.x, 172.16-31.x)
- **External Targets**: Require `AUTHORIZATION.txt` file
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Always obtain proper authorization before scanning

### Best Practices
1. **Always obtain written permission** before scanning any target
2. **Use safe mode** for production environments
3. **Start with small target lists** to test performance
4. **Monitor resource usage** with large scans
5. **Review reports carefully** before taking action
